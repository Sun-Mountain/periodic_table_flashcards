# In Progress
* ~~Creating alternative quizzes~~
    * ~~Quiz element name~~
    * ~~Quiz element symbol~~
* ~~Quiz counters (correct vs. wrong vs. skipped)~~
    * ~~Remove correct answers from rotation~~
* ~~Make sure spaces don't read as a wrong answer~~
* Make adding & subtracting loop around the elements
* Specify which elements to quiz on (number range)
    * Groups of elements
* Reduce code by passing up states & functions used in multiple components
* Make a stricter Test option
